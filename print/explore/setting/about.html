      <h2 class="mb-4">About ArcherStudio</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>ArcherCorporation</strong> was established in October 2023, born from a simple thought — "What if I try to create that? What if I build this?" What started as a small school helper has since grown into a broader vision aimed at helping more people through creativity, innovation, and service. Today, it continues to evolve under the umbrella of <strong>ArcherCorp</strong>, encompassing multiple branches:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ArcherCorp</strong> – The central hub and management of all Archer divisions.</li>
          <li><strong>ArcherStudio</strong> – Focused on multimedia production, including video editing, photography, and creative storytelling.</li>
          <li><strong>ArcherPrint</strong> – Offers printing services for documents, posters, creatives, and more.</li>
          <li><strong>ArcherStudy</strong> – A student-centered platform that provides academic support and tools for learning.</li>
          <li><strong>ArcherCinema</strong> – Brings the cinematic experience to homes through curated media and projection setups.</li>
          <li><strong>ArcherDev</strong> – Develops websites, applications, and system solutions for both academic and business use.</li>
          <li><strong>ArcherDesign</strong> – A creative studio offering branding, graphic design, and digital content solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each branch reflects a commitment to quality, creativity, and service — driven by a passion to build, serve, and innovate.
        </p>

      <h5 class="my-4">Our Inspiration</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>ArcherCorporation</strong> draws inspiration from the fictional Umbrella Corporation in the movie <em>Resident Evil</em>. Fascinated by the futuristic technology and innovation portrayed in the film, the founder envisioned building a creative empire grounded in real-world solutions, creativity, and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The branding of <strong>ArcherCorp</strong> is inspired by the constellation <strong>Sagittarius</strong> — the archer. The logo merges the letters “A” and “M”, symbolizing both the archer's form and the initials of the founder, <strong>Mark</strong>. The arrow points upward, representing the core value of <strong>“Aim High”</strong>. Interestingly, the archer's bow remains unstrung — the string rests gently beneath the arrow, signifying potential energy, silent focus, and the calm before release. It embodies patience, discipline, and the idea that every great shot begins with stillness and intent.
      </p>


      <div class="text-center my-4">
        <img src="../../resources/img/logo/app-logo.png" alt="ArcherCorp Logo" style="height: 100px;" />
      </div>

      <p>
        ArcherCorp serves as the guardian of the founder’s work — from videos and photography to design and research. Through <strong>ArcherStudio</strong>, these creative outputs are safely stored and archived, preserving the legacy and creative journey that began in <strong>2023</strong>.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mt-4">With Gratitude</h5>
      <p>
        ArcherCorp would not exist without the unwavering support of friends who believed in the vision even before it was fully formed. Their encouragement, time, and contributions — whether in brainstorming, helping with shoots, testing platforms, or simply staying present — played a crucial role in turning ideas into reality. This isn't just one person's project — it's a shared journey.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mt-4">Our Mission</h5>
      <p>
        To empower students, creators, and local communities by providing accessible, innovative, and high-quality printing, media, and digital solutions — driven by passion, purpose, and the pursuit of continuous improvement.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mt-4">Our Vision</h5>
      <p>
       To become a trusted creative ecosystem that transforms ideas into impact — inspiring growth through design, education, technology, while preserving and celebrating every step of the journey since 2023.
      </p>

      <h5 class="mt-4">A Note from the Founder</h5>
      <p>
        ArcherStudio began with nothing but curiosity, passion, and the question: "What if?" As an ICT student with a love for design, tech, and storytelling, I wanted to create something that could help others the same way it helped me — by making tools, services, and inspiration more accessible. This is just the beginning, and I’m grateful to everyone who's been part of the journey.
        <br><br>
        — <strong>Mark Anthony Espora</strong>, Founder
