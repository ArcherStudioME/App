            <li>
              Deliveries to other destinations, including residential addresses, offices, and public areas, are subject to varying rates depending on distance, mode of delivery (e.g., motorbike, courier service), and urgency. Final delivery fees will be communicated and confirmed before dispatch.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Time Constraints:</strong> As the service is operated by a student, availability may be limited during academic periods.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Content Restrictions:</strong> We strictly reserve the right to refuse printing any content that promotes or contains violence, harassment, hate speech, threats, sexually explicit material, terrorist propaganda, or content in violation of the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, including Republic Act No. 10175 (Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012).
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Copyrighted Materials:</strong> It is the client’s sole responsibility to ensure that uploaded materials do not violate any copyright, trademark, or intellectual property laws, as stated under Republic Act No. 8293 (Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines). We reserve the right to reject requests that may infringe upon such rights without liability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Technical Limitations:</strong> We may reject files that are corrupted, poorly formatted, too low in resolution, or otherwise incompatible with our equipment or processing systems. Clients are encouraged to review file guidelines prior to submission.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Equipment Downtime:</strong> Printing operations may be temporarily unavailable due to equipment maintenance, consumable shortages (e.g., ink, paper), or interruptions in electricity and internet service. We will make reasonable efforts to notify customers of any expected service disruptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Discretionary Right:</strong> We reserve the right to decline any print job that, in our sole discretion, is deemed inappropriate, harmful, unlawful, or misaligned with our ethical values. This may be done with or without providing detailed justification.
            </li>

        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            By submitting a print job, the client affirms and warrants that they are the rightful owner of the content or have secured all necessary licenses, permissions, or legal rights to use, reproduce, and distribute the material.
          </li>
          <li>
            In accordance with Republic Act No. 8293 (Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines), clients are fully accountable for any copyright or trademark infringement resulting from their submitted content.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not conduct prior review, verification, or monitoring of intellectual property ownership. As such, any claims of infringement or legal disputes must be directed to the client who submitted the content, not to our service or its operators.
          </li>
          <li>
            We expressly disclaim any liability for legal consequences arising from the use of copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise protected materials provided by clients. This includes, but is not limited to, penalties, damages, or cease-and-desist orders.
          </li>
